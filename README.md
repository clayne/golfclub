Hey there! I made this repo to track source files for binary golf.

## What is binary golf?

To put it simply, it's creating the smallest possible binary that still does
something. There have been numerous patterns in the past to create things 
like this (see: demoscene), but many of these examples only run on older 
systems. My intention was to explore some of the code patterns and tricks
that are necessary to make impossibly tiny binaries work on modern systems.

The examples contained in this first iteration are ELF64 files, meant to 
run on 64 bit Linux systems. They will be expanded on and sorted by processor
arch and operating system in the future.

## What is the goal?

I'm hoping that these files will inspire others to create very tiny versions
of things on all types of modern systems, and play with their target platform
in order to do more with less.

## How can I contribute?

Play around with some of the examples, and write your own! See what you can do
with a few bytes and build your way up. I'm looking to do some streams on 
developing these sorts of things and how to make them useful, as well as more
write ups on specific techniques and errata.
